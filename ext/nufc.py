If you actually read into game, it's moved on from silly one liners and \"negging\" in the 80's (long before my time) to becoming a cool guy who brings value to girls lives around you, by working on yourself and understanding what the girl truly wants. Girls want to meet a cool guy \"who understands her\", right? It's more about the vibe and body language you give off and \"lines\" are actually pretty heavily advised against. \n\nWhen I said 5/6 I wasn't just talking about looks but personality aswell. However if you class judging whether a girl is attractive or not as objectifying women, which is what you are implying. then I hate to break it to you but women and in fact everyone does this all the time. In fact any man who buys a girl a drink, flowers or a meal is \"objectifying women\". Would you buy your friend a meal or flowers? \n\nNearly every women you have encountered (in your demographic), even on a subconscious level has judged whether they find you attractive or not (not just your looks), she's probably even ranked you compared to other guys she's met. That's just the dynamic between men and women.")
